# Summary

This script is used to select the faces of a mesh object in Blender that are on the positive X axis. It does this by looping through all the faces in the mesh and checking the position of each vertex in the face. If all the vertices in the face are on the positive X axis, the face is added to a list of selected faces. The script then selects all the faces in the list. If the active object in Blender is not a mesh, an error message is printed.

# Usage

- Download or Save the script as a Python file on your computer, for example "select_plus_x_faces.py", in a location that is easily accessible.
- In Blender, go to the "Text Editor" window and click on the "New" button to create a new text block.
- In the text block, click on the "Open" button and select the Python file that contains the script.
- With the script open in the text block, click on the "Run Script" button to run the script.

- After running the script, the selected faces of the mesh object should be highlighted in the viewport, and you can then proceed to perform further actions on these faces, such as deleting them or applying a modifier.
